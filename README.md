# Cosmetics_Data_Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of a cosmetics company's sales data. 

## Data

The data is stored in an Excel file named `Cosmetics-Inc.xlsx`. 

## Analysis

The analysis is performed in R, and the script is `Cosmetics_Analysis.R`.

The script creates the following visualizations:

1. A pie chart showing the distribution of sales by product ID.
2. A bar chart showing the total number of orders for each client.
3. A map showing the total products sold by state.

The script uses the following libraries: `readxl`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `maps`, `ggmap`, and `ggrepel`.
